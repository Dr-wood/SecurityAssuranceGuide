# Open Source Security Assurance Guide

The OpenChain Specification working group’s core mission is to develop Program standards that establish trust in the Open Source from which modern-day software solutions are built. The OpenChain project’s flagship specification, ISO 5230 International Standard for Open Source Compliance, focuses on establishing trust around Open Source license compliance. As a natural next step in support of the broader mission of establishing trust in Open Source, the working group developed this guide to identify and describe the minimum core set of requirements that every Security Assurance program should satisfy with respect to the use of Open Source software. Initially the scope is limited to ensuring that an organization vets the  Open Source used with regard to known publicly available security vulnerability issues (e.g., CVEs, github dependency alerts, package manager alerts and so forth).  The guide’s scope may be expanded overtime based on community feedback.

The OOOOpenChain Specification working group’s core mission is to develop program standards that establish trust in the open source from which modern-day software solutions are built. The OpenChain project’s flagship specification, ISO 5230 International Standard, is currently focused on establishing trust around open source license compliance. In support of its mission, the working group has embarked on an exploratory initiative to develop a set of requirements that serve as a benchmark every quality open-source security assurance program would satisfy. 
Conformance with this reference guide provides assurance that an organization has a program in place that takes the expected steps necessary to establish a high level of security assurance with respect to the open source used.
